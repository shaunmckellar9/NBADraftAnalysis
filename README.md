Comprehensive Analysis of NBA Draft Trends
Overview
This project aims to analyze NBA draft trends with a focus on evaluating career longevity, performance metrics, and the success of top 3 picks. Inspired by my passion for basketball and favorite teams, this project leverages data science techniques to uncover insights about player trajectories and team strategies.

Objectives
Evaluate career longevity of NBA players.
Analyze performance metrics including points per game, rebounds, assists, and more.
Assess the success rate of top 3 draft picks.
Compare player performance trends across different draft years and teams.
Data and Tools
Dataset: NBA Draft Data
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
Techniques: Data Cleaning, PCA, Clustering, Regression Analysis
Analysis and Insights
Career Longevity
Objective: Identify factors influencing the career longevity of NBA players.
Methodology: Used OLS regression to model the impact of various performance metrics on career longevity.
Key Findings: Points per game, games played, and value over replacement significantly impact career longevity.
Performance Metrics
Objective: Compare performance metrics across draft years and teams.
Methodology: Visualized data using pair plots, bar charts, and scatter plots.
Key Findings: Teams like the Lakers and UNC Tar Heels consistently produce high-performing players.
Success of Top 3 Picks
Objective: Analyze the success rate of top 3 draft picks.
Methodology: Compared win shares, points per game, and years active for top picks.
Key Findings: Top picks often have longer, more successful careers.
